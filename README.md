# ganImageGenerator

Project utilised to better understand CNNs, GANs, Pytorch and Tensorflow

Looking at CNNs with Pytorch and at DCGANs with Tensorflow, both using the MNIST Dataset.

CNN in Pytorch trains at about 4 seconds per epoch over at most 100 epochs with the current model. Accuracy on test set is 97.25% 

GAN is up and running, but has not been trained yet. For 50 epochs the estimated time is 3.5ish hours. Still have doubts about if the number generation is working correctly.
