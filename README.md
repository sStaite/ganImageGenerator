# ganImageGenerator

Project utilised to better understand CNNs, GANs, Pytorch and Tensorflow

Looking at CNNs with Pytorch and at DCGANs with Tensorflow, both using the MNIST Dataset.

CNN in Pytorch trains very slowly - I think this is due to the fact that I cannot figure out (an easy way) to use my GPUs. However, the neural network should work
